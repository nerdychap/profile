			<h3>About me</h3>
			<br>
			<div>
				I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from the University of Cape Town
				and a self-taught Software Developer/Engineer. My academic career has equipped me with skills ranging
				from Electronic Circuit Design,
				Embedded Development, Robotics, Automation, Instrumentation, Control Engineering and Mechanical Design.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				I developed a passion for coding when I was introduced to programming in my first year in university. I
				enjoyed the introductory Python course
				and found coding as an important skill to acquire. I did embedded development in my university career
				and it involved coding but only limited
				to hardware. I wanted to further upskill on my coding skills and tech stack so as soon as I completed my
				qualification, I started focusing
				on object-oriented programming and went on to do web development. I am ready to begin my career as a
				full-time
				Full-Stack Developer and Software Engineer.

		<h3>Education and Experience</h3>
		<div class="">
			<h4>Education</h4>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">University of Cape Town [2014 - 2018]</div>
				<div>BSc(Eng) - Mechatronics Engineering</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Umkhumbi High School [2009 - 2013]</div>
				<div>NSC - Grade 12</div>

		<div class="">
			<h4>Experience</h4>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Electronics Engineer - Thingking Studio [Jan 2019 - Apr 2019]</div>
				<div>I was working as an Electronics Engineer. I carried out all the tasks that required the skills of
					an electronics engineer which included electronic systems design, sensor measurement, embedded
					software development using C++ and Python, conducting research in designing electronic systems using
					microcontrollers and power systems. </div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Control Systems Intern - Absa Aliens [Jun 2018 - July 2018]</div>
				<div>I was working as a control systems intern evaluating different control engineering methods to
					design a controller for a nonlinear inverted pendulum. I also developed a program using C++ to
					implement the designed controller on the inverted pendulum system. </div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Process Safety Management Intern - Sasol [Dec 2017 - Jan 2018]</div>
				<div>I was working alongside a process safety manager where we were focusing on the safety of people
					working in the production plants. Responsibilities included evaluating risks and incidents that
					occurred in the plant and devise ways to mitigate those risks and incidents that might occur.</div>

		<div class="">
			<h4>Soft Skills</h4>
			<div>
				<h5>Problem Solver</h5>
				<div>I broke down my final year project into small chunks to make the workload more manageable. This
					enabled me to be able to solve the problem of having a big projecting looking like a difficult task
					while it is just a combination of small tasks.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Self-starter</h5>
				<div>I started my research project before the beginning of the academic term during my internship at
					Absa Aliens. I made a consultation with my lecturer before the beginning of the semester to get an
					understanding of the project requirements and topics to be covered in order for me to be ahead of
					time.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Ability to adapt to changing environments</h5>
				<div>I managed to adapt to a non-technical environment at Sasol as a Process Safety Management Intern.
					Main focus of the job involved generating reports on incidents on the production plant and trying to
					mitigate the risks of incidents from occuring and raising awareness on hazards that are on the
					plant.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Communication skills</h5>
				<div>I communicated with first-year students during my term as a mentor. Even though I was a senior, I
					was able to speak to juniors and my mentoring term was a success because I also got a high rating as
					a mentor.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Analytical skills</h5>
				<div>I collected data then plotted graphs to determine the behavior of the pendulum system for my final
					year project using my analytical skills. I analysed the graphs and extracted information about the
					response of the system due to different forces and initial angles of launch.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Team player</h5>
				<div>Working as a student front-desk assistant equipped me with team-working skills as we were a team of
					assistants. I obtained conflict resolution skills and learned how to understand that team
					environments involve people with different personalities and work ethics.</div>
			</div>

		<h3>My Projects</h3>
		<div>These are projects that I developed on my own from conceptual stage to deployment.</div>
		<h5>Weather Apps</h5>
		<p>Weather App developed using AngularJS and ReactJS as the frameworks. I used openweather API to retrieve
			current weather forecast and
			the geolocation API to find the location of the user.</p>

		<h3>Work Projects</h3>
		<div>These are projects that I was responsible for at work. I developed them by transforming UX and UI designs
			to interactive
			web pages.</div>
