        <div id="about">
            <p>
                I am a Front-End Developer with expertise in JavaScript, specializing in crafting dynamic web and mobile applications using React and React Native. Holding a Bachelor of Science in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Cape Town, I've honed
                my passion for coding since my first introduction to programming during university. Initially drawn to embedded development, where coding controlled hardware, I transitioned to full-time software development to broaden my skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, armed with extensive software development experience, I'm eager to merge my problem-solving prowess and engineering background with software development to tackle intricate challenges and implement innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>Recently, I've expanded my skill set into UX/UI design, mastering design tools like Figma for prototyping and wireframing. This dual expertise allows me to create intuitive and visually appealing experiences for users, blending technical prowess
                with design sensibility.</p>
