			<h3>About me</h3>
			<br>
			<div>
				I am a Full-Stack Software Developer working as a Front-End Developer for a digital Marketing Agency. I
				possess a Bachelor of Science in Engineering specializing in Mechatronics from the University of Cape
				Town.
				I am interested in solving complex problems using mathematical modelling, using analytical skills to
				analyse the problem and implementing solutions by developing software programmes.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				I developed a passion for coding when I was introduced to programming in my first year in university. I
				enjoyed the introductory Python course
				and found coding as an important skill to acquire. I focused on embedded development in my university
				career
				and it involved coding but only limited
				to developing programs used to control hardware. I wanted to further upskill on my coding skills and
				tech stack so as soon as I completed my
				qualification, I started focusing
				on software development as a full-time career.
				<br><br>
				As I have acquired the software development skills and experience, I am ready to combine my
				problem-solving, engineering skillset and expertise with software development to solve complex problems
				and implement the proposed solutions using software programmes.

					technologies. I designed the applications and developed them from scratch. This also included
					testing and deploying the final products.</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Electronics Engineer - Thingking Studio <br>[Jan 2019 - Apr 2019]</div>
				<div>I was working as an Electronics Engineer. I carried out all the tasks that required the skills of
					an electronics engineer which included electronic systems design, sensor measurement, embedded
					software development using C++ and Python, conducting research in designing electronic systems using
					microcontrollers and power systems. </div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				<div class="institution">Control Systems Intern - Absa Aliens <br>[Jun 2018 - July 2018]</div>
				<div>I was working as a control systems intern evaluating different control engineering methods to
					design a controller for a nonlinear inverted pendulum. I also developed a program using C++ to
					implement the designed controller on the inverted pendulum system. </div>
			</div>

		<div class="">
			<h4>Soft Skills</h4>
			<div>
				<h5>Problem Solver</h5>
				<div>I broke down my final year project into small chunks to make the workload more manageable. This
					enabled me to be able to solve the problem of having a big projecting looking like a difficult task
					while it is just a combination of small tasks.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Self-starter</h5>
				<div>I started my research project before the beginning of the academic term during my internship at
					Absa Aliens. I made a consultation with my lecturer before the beginning of the semester to get an
					understanding of the project requirements and topics to be covered in order for me to be ahead of
					time.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Ability to adapt to changing environments</h5>
				<div>I managed to adapt to a non-technical environment at Sasol as a Process Safety Management Intern.
					The main focus of the job involved generating reports on incidents on the production plant and
					trying to
					mitigate the risks of incidents from occuring and raising awareness on hazards that are on the
					plant.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Communication skills</h5>
				<div>I communicated with first-year students during my term as a mentor. Even though I was a senior, I
					was able to speak to juniors and my mentoring term was a success because I also got a high rating as
					a mentor.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Analytical skills</h5>
				<div>I collected data then plotted graphs to determine the behavior of the pendulum system for my final
					year project using my analytical skills. I analysed the graphs and extracted information about the
					response of the system due to different forces and initial angles of launch.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Team player</h5>
				<div>Working as a student front-desk assistant equipped me with team-working skills as we were a team of
					assistants. I obtained conflict resolution skills and learned how to understand that team
					environments involve people with different personalities and work ethics.</div>
			</div>
		</div>

	<div id="work" style="display: none;">
		<h3>My Projects</h3>
		<div>These are projects that I developed on my own from conceptual stage to deployment.</div>
		<h5>Weather Apps</h5>
		<p>Weather App developed using AngularJS and ReactJS as the frameworks. I used openweather API to retrieve
			current weather forecast and
			the geolocation API to find the location of the user.</p>
		<h5>Dreamshare Single Page</h5>
		<p>This is a single page website that I developed to demonstrate my skill in developing a web page. I used HTML,
			SASS(CSS) and some jQuery(Javascript) to view all footer links. The webpage is also responsive to all device
			sizes.</p>
		<h5>Covid-19 Data Tracker[In Progress]</h5>
		<p>This is a single page application that I developed using ReactJS. It shows you the Covid-19 data for a
			country that you select on the dropdown list. I used a covid-19 API to get the data.</p>
