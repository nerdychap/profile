			<h3>About me</h3>
			<br>
			<div>
				I am a Front-End Developer specialising in Javascript. I build web and mobile applications using React
				and React Native. I
				possess a Bachelor of Science in Engineering specializing in Mechatronics from the University of Cape
				Town.
				I am interested in developing UI for web and mobile applications. 
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				I developed a passion for coding when I was introduced to programming in my first year in university. I
				enjoyed the introductory Python course
				and found coding as an important skill to acquire. I focused on embedded development in my university
				career
				and it involved coding but only limited
				to developing programs used to control hardware. I wanted to further improve on my coding skills and
				tech stack so, as soon as I completed my
				qualification, I started focusing
				on software development as a full-time career.
				<br><br>
				As I have acquired the software development skills and experience, I am ready to combine my
				problem-solving, engineering skillset and expertise with software development to solve complex problems
				and implement the proposed solutions using software programmes.

			<h4>Soft Skills</h4>
			<div>
				<h5>Problem Solver</h5>
				<div>My current company did not have a mobile developer and they wanted to venture into mobile
					development. I decided
					to solve that problem by dedicating my time and effort to learn mobile app development and started
					building the first mobile app
					in the company's history.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Self-starter</h5>
				<div>I started learning how to develop mobile applications using React Native out of passion and interest
					in React and its frameworks.</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Ability to adapt to changing environments</h5>
				<div>I am more of a technical person but the client engagements and working hand in hand with them to
					draft solution design documents and client requirements
					successfully has taught me to easily adapt to an environment I am not used to.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Communication skills</h5>
				<div>I communicate with colleagues to deliver efficient applications. This also involves communicating with
					clients to determine their needs and build a product
					that meets their requirements.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h5>Team player</h5>
				<div>Working in a small front-end team, I have been able to help out other developers with ways of
					optimizing their code, debugging, and best practices with Javascript and React.</div>
			</div>

		<h3>My Projects</h3>
		<div>These are projects that I developed on my own from conceptual stage to deployment.</div>
		<h5>Ecommerce Mobile App</h5>
		<p>I developed this mobile application using React Native to emulate a small scale ecomerce store  with functionality to view items as a list and individually,
			get more information about the item and adding and removing it from the cart.
		</p>
		<h5>Weather App</h5>
		<p>Weather App developed using AngularJS as the framework. I used openweathermap API to retrieve
			current weather forecast and
			the geolocation API to find the location of the user.</p>
		<h5>Shopping Cart</h5>
		<p>Progressive Web App developed using ReactJS. It emulates a shopping cart where you can add items, their
			prices and quantity and it gives you the total cost before you reach the till. The item name, price and
			quantity can also be edited individually. The app can work offline and is also installable on the home
			screen.
			It uses styled-components to style the pages and React Hooks to manage state.</p>
		<h5>Dreamshare Single Page</h5>
		<p>This is a single page website that I developed to demonstrate my skill in developing a web page. I used HTML,
			SASS(CSS) and some jQuery(Javascript) to view all footer links. The webpage is also responsive to all device
			sizes.</p>
		<h5>Covid-19 Data Tracker</h5>
		<p>This is a single page application that I developed using ReactJS. It shows you the Covid-19 data for a
			country that you select on the dropdown list. I used a covid-19 API to get the data.
			<br> The refurbished version of the application will show advanced UI with Covid data visualizations that includes graphs and charts.
		</p>
		<h5>User Profiles</h5>
		<p>This is a single page application that I developed using ReactJS which pulls up a list of users in UI card
			formats. When you click on a user, it takes you to a new page with more information about the clicked user.
