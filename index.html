		<h3>About me</h3>
		<br>
			<div>
				I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from the University of Cape Town 
				and a self-taught Software Developer/Engineer. My academic career has equipped me with skills ranging from Electronic Circuit Design, 
				Embedded Development, Robotics, Automation, Instrumentation, Control Engineering and Mechanical Design. 
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				I developed a passion for coding when I was introduced to programming in my first year in university. I enjoyed the introductory Python course
				and found coding as an important skill to acquire. I did embedded development in my university career and it involved coding but only limited
				to hardware. I wanted to further upskill on my coding skills and tech stack so as soon as I completed my qualification, I started focusing
				on object-oriented programming and went on to do web development. I am ready to begin my career as a full-time 
				Full-Stack Developer and Software Engineer.
